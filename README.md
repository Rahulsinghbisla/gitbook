Ordinal data means data is in a specific order like take an example of high school or education in which data of UG PG PHD data there is order that UG\<PG\<PHD this is ordinal data type&#x20;

## <mark style="color:blue;">One Hot Encoding :- For nominal encoding data</mark>

In the previous encoding we discuss that we distribbute our data in the preferance of higher order than lower soo on&#x20;

But in this we have different data of color in which we can't prefered them in any order so we we have to arrange that col in specific pattern like

&#x20;           <mark style="color:yellow;">Yellow</mark>                <mark style="color:green;">Green</mark>                <mark style="color:blue;">Blue</mark>                <mark style="color:red;">Red</mark>
